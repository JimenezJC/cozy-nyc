## Sorry about this...

Check out [@bertho-zero](https://github.com/bertho-zero)'s [docs](https://github.com/bertho-zero/react-redux-universal-hot-example/tree/master/docs) for their [react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/bertho-zero/react-redux-universal-hot-example) project which cozy.nyc is built off of.
